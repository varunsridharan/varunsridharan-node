A self-taught person than a main stream academic, I started development with core PHP for development of websites and applications very early in life. 
I was introduced to WordPress for the first time in 2004.

I have been a hardcore open-source developer building plugins for WordPress and WooCommerce since 2007. 
It has been an amazing 13-year journey with WordPress, and I look forward to more!

> I ❤️ Open Source!
